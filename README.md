# Machine-Learning
Testing 2 different sets accuracy and Training the model using KNN Classifier
Tried with two different data
1st one is Iris Data, which is relatively smaller and balanced dataset,got the accuracy around 95%
2nd one is Wine dataset which is a bigger dataset when compared to Iris, and also checked the relationship between the datapoints as well here
Accuracy of Wine data set was close to 70% around Kvalue 10 to 15
